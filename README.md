# HTML5
Tasks from Integrify Acadamic
In this updated version, I added a title tag to give the page a title, and I also added a meta tag for the viewport, which allows the page to be responsive to different screen sizes. Additionally, I added some content to the page, including a header, several sections with headings and paragraphs, an ordered and unordered list, and a contact form. Finally, I added a footer with a copyright notice.
